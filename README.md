https://github.com/nmstate/nmstate/issues/2583

This small module basically demonstrates the power of NLP in network configuration I.e
Our demo project aims to develop a natural language interface that allows users to create Linux bridge configurations using simple, human-readable commands. The interface will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse user input and generate YAML configurations compatible with nmstate, a declarative API for host network management in Linux.
